# Reverse engineering the polio virus

**You can start here**: [`polio.py`](polio.py)

## :thought_balloon: Background
This project applies techniques from [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processor) to understand the [Polio]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio) virus. The goal here is to build an understaning of this virus from the first basis.

### Biology versus Software
